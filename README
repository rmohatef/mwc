This repository contains the c++ source codes of the machine learning model for problem reduction to solve maximum weight clique problems.

------------------
install & compile:
------------------
packages required: 1) cmake-2.8.4 or above; and 2) gcc-7.3.0 or above
install: 'git clone https://github.com/yuansuny/mwc.git'
compile: 1) move to the directory: 'cd mwc'
	 2) create a build directory: 'mkdir build'
         3) move to the build directory: 'cd build'
         4) run cmake: 'cmake ..'
         5) run makefile: 'make'

usage:
------
Usage: ./MWC [options] datafile
options: 
    -m : set problem reduction method (default 3)
	0 -- no problem reduction
	1 -- correlation-based measure
	2 -- ranking-based measure
	3 -- kernel SVM, dual (training and testing are slow)
	4 -- linear SVM, primal (training and testing are fast)
    -n : whether training is required (default 0)
	0 -- training is not required; using ML model already trained
	1 -- training is required; train a ML model to use; the training graphs can be specified in the src/main.cpp file; the optimal solutions for the training graphs are required.
    -k kernel_type : set type of kernel function for kernel SVM (default 2)"
	0 -- linear: u'*v"
	1 -- polynomial: (gamma*u'*v + coef0)^degree
	2 -- radial basis function: exp(-gamma*|u-v|^2)
	3 -- sigmoid: tanh(gamma*u'*v + coef0)
    -t : set the cutoff time in seconds (default 1000 seconds)
    -c : set the threshold for correlation-based measure (default 0.0)
    -r : set the threshold for ranking-based measure (default 0.01)
    -a : set the penalty for miss-classifying positive data for SVM em*num0/num1 (default 10)

---------
examples:
---------
./MWC p_hat1000-2                       : solve the graph p_hat1000-2.wclq using default parameter setting (kernel SVM etc).
./MWC -m 0 p_hat1000-2                  : solve the original graph p_hat1000-2.wclq without problem reduction.
./MWC -m 4 p_hat1000-2                  : solve the graph p_hat1000-2.wclq using linear SVM as preprocessing method. 
./MWC -m 1 -c 0.01 -t 100 p_hat1000-2   : solve the graph p_hat1000-2.wclq using correlation-based measure with threashold 0.01 as preprocessing method; cutoff time set to 100 seconds.
./MWC -m 3 -n 1 -k 1 -a 100 p_hat1000-2 : train a SVM model with polynomial kernel and penalty a=100 to solve the graph p_hat1000-2.wclq; you can specify the training graphs in the src/main.cpp file.
